# Spatio-Temporal Beam-Level Traffic Forecasting

##  Problem Statement
Telecommunication networks must efficiently manage resources to maintain high-quality service. The **Spatio-Temporal Beam-Level Traffic Forecasting Challenge** aims to **predict future traffic patterns at individual network beams**, including data throughput, user counts, and resource utilization.

Accurate forecasts help **network operators** optimize resource allocation, prevent congestion, and improve overall service quality.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **beam-level network metrics** collected over time, provided as CSV files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `traffic_DLThpVol.csv` | Downlink throughput volume per beam (amount of data transmitted). |
| `traffic_DLThpTime.csv` | Downlink throughput time (time intervals for throughput measurements). |
| `traffic_DLPRB.csv` | Physical Resource Block (PRB) utilization (radio resource usage per beam). |
| `traffic_MR_number.csv` | User count per beam (number of connected users reporting measurements). |

Each file represents a **time series** for multiple beams across multiple timestamps.

##  Approach

### 1. Time Series Analysis
- Forecast future values for each metric (`DLThpVol`, `DLPRB`, `MR_number`).  
- Models:
  - **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Units)
  - **Temporal CNN**
  - **Transformers**
  - **XGBoost / Gradient Boosting** (classical ML baseline)
- Multi-variate models combine multiple metrics for improved prediction.

### 2. Clustering
- Cluster beams based on usage patterns (e.g., ‚Äúhigh traffic & high user count‚Äù).  
- Helps network operators identify usage types and optimize configurations.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction
- Extract embeddings of beam traffic patterns.  
- Apply **t-SNE**, **UMAP**, or **PCA** for 2D/3D visualization of beam similarity.

### 4. Neural Networks
- Build **multi-variate spatio-temporal models** using CNN + LSTM or Transformers.  
- Input: multiple metrics per beam over time.  
- Output: predicted traffic, PRB utilization, or user counts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Handle missing timestamps or NaN values.  
2. **Resampling** ‚Äì Align all files to uniform time intervals.  
3. **Normalization** ‚Äì Scale features for neural networks (e.g., min-max or z-score).  
4. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Create metrics such as:
   - Throughput per user (`DLThpVol / MR_number`)  
   - PRB utilization percentage  
   - Rolling averages or temporal differences  
5. **Train-Validation-Test Split** ‚Äì Typically chronological to prevent leakage.  
6. **Time Series Checks** ‚Äì  
   - Check for **stationarity**  
   - Check for **autocorrelation**  
   - Check for **seasonality**

##  Deployment
The model will be deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive visualization of predictions and clusters.
